WHERE X IS null

inner join equivalent to above 
FROM x INNER JOIN x2 on x.r = x2.r

PULOCATIONID NOT IN (SELECT "LocationID" FROM zones) - if query displays records then it would mean that they contain diff values

GROUP BY (a column and aggregate afterwards)

DATE_TRUNC('DAY', tpep_dropoff_datetime) || CAST(X AS DATE)


saw joins, group by(aggregate by column), order by, joins, sub queries, check for null, casting datetime to juste date
